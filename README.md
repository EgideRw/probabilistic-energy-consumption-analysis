Statistical Modeling and Probabilistic Analysis of Household Energy Consumption
Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of Electrical Power Engineering and Computational Statistics. While power systems are often studied through deterministic models, this project applies stochastic modeling to understand the inherent uncertainty in consumer behavior and its impact on the electrical grid.

Mathematical & Statistical Core
Stochastic Data Generation: Modeled household energy usage as a random variable following a Normal Distribution based on empirical energy consumption parameters.

Probabilistic Density Function (PDF): Implemented theoretical PDF fitting to compare simulated consumption data against Gaussian expectations.

Monte Carlo Simulation: Conducted 10,000 iterations of total grid demand to quantify the probability of system-wide overloading.

Law of Large Numbers: Demonstrated the convergence of sampled means toward expected theoretical values as simulation scale increased.

Learning Context
This project was developed as a personal challenge during my independent Python learning path on Sololearn. It represents my initiative to apply programming tools to solve complex problems in Probability and Statistics, moving beyond traditional classroom assignments.
